# ElGamalHomomorphicMultiplication
ELGamal Homomorphic Multiplication with RSA digital signatures, for Cryptography.



# this code is for proof of concept of ElGamal homomorphic multiplication 
# with RSA signature verification to ensure the result is correct
# ElGamal can be used for a variety of homomorphic operations such as:
# addition, multiplication, exponentiation, etc.
# for this implemenation, we will use multiplication

# the RSA and ElGamal keys are stored in keys.txt
# the encrypted values are stored in encrypted_values.txt
# the input variables are stored in input_variables.txt
# the decrypted result is printed to the console
