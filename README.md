# ElGamal Homomorphic Multiplication
ELGamal Homomorphic Multiplication with RSA digital signatures, for Cryptography.


Code found in main.py file.


This code is for proof of concept of ElGamal homomorphic multiplication with RSA signature verification to ensure the result is correct.

ElGamal can be used for a variety of homomorphic operations such as:

  - addition, multiplication, exponentiation, etc.

For this implemenation, we will use multiplication.


The RSA and ElGamal keys are stored in keys.txt,
the encrypted values are stored in encrypted_values.txt,
the input variables are stored in input_variables.txt,
the decrypted result is printed to the console.
